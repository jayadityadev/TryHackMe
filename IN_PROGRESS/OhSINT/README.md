This room doesn't have a vulnerable machine to work with. Rather it requires the use of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) to answer the questions related to the file given to be downloaded.

## Examining the given file:

* ### Executing some basic file operations to see if something strikes

	> ls -l

	```
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 b1ack b1ack 234081 Mar 14 15:42 WindowsXP.jpg
	```

	> eog WindowsXP.jpg

	The image is the classic OG WindowsXP background wallpaper. <br>
	Let's see what we can extract from this image.

	Exiftool is a command line utility that shows the exif information embedded within the image.

* ### Examining the exif data and searching the web

	* It appears that the owner of the file might be somewhat related to the copyright owner. Let's browse the web to see if something matches with the given data.

	* Found some social media accounts under the name `OWoodflint`.

		[Twitter](https://twitter.com/owoodflint?lang=en) <br>
		[GitHub](https://github.com/OWoodfl1nt/)

	* Exploring the Twitter account for this person, we find that he uses a free Wireless Access Point with the BSSID: `B4:5D:50:AA:86:41`. Searching for this BSSID on [Wigle](wigle.net) (NOTE: Wigle wasn't showing the WAP name without creating a user, so created a temporary user on wigle using temp mail and searching via Search > Advanced Search)

		![Wigle Search result](Screenshot%202024-03-17%20232010.png)

	* Also, there's a repository `people_finder` in the user's GitHub account that gives some relative intelligence about the owner.

	* The `people_finder` repo also shows that there's a blog website of this user on [Wordpress](https://oliverwoodflint.wordpress.com/).

	* Exploring the blog, gives some more relevant details such as the statement:
		```
		Im in New York right now, so I will update this site right away with new photos!
		```
		which might be the answer to one of the THM Questions.

	* Looking up in the source code of the Wordpress blog, something peculiar comes up:
	
		```HTML
		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Im in New York right now, so I will update this site right away with new photos!</p>
		<p style="color:#ffffff;" class="has-text-color">pennYDr0pper.!</p>
		</div><!-- .entry-content -->
		```

		There's a white text written in the HTML page, `pennYDr0pper.!`, which might be the person's password.


<br>

## THM Questions:

* _Q1_: What is this user's avatar of? <br> _A_: `cat`
* _Q2_: What city is this person in? <br> _A_: `London`
* _03_: What is the SSID of the WAP he connected to? <br> _A_: `UnileverWifi`
* _Q4_: What is his personal email address? <br> _A_: `owoodflint@gmail.com`
* _Q5_: What site did you find his email address on? <br> _A_: `GitHub`
* _06_: Where has he gone on holiday? <br> _A_: `New York`
* _07_: What is the person's password? <br> _A_: `pennYDr0pper.!`
